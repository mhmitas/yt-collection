# Youtube Video Collection

## Tired of getting distracted on YouTube?

When watching videos on YouTube, I often find myself scrolling through recommendations, checking likes, or reading comments, only to realize I’ve lost track of my original task. 😅 Does this happen to you too?
</br></br>
That’s why I built a simple web app to solve this distraction problem! 🙌 Now you can watch YouTube videos without all the noise – no recommendations, no comments, no distractions.

How it works❔
Just click ‘Share’ under the video to get the link, or copy the link directly from the video page. and then paste it into my app. Hit save, and you’re all set to watch, distraction-free!
